# 🏡 House Price Prediction Using Regression
This project predicts house prices using regression techniques like Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Polynomial Regression. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA, and model evaluation. Built using Python and scikit-learn, it aims to accurately estimate home values from real-world housing data.
